# Parts Finder

This program will search local inventory of car part yards and cross-reference the parts of available cars with recent sales on Ebay. The goal is to send email alerts to the end-user to locate high-value products.

## Examples:
This fuse box from a 2004-2009 MAZDA 3 will fetch a handsome profit and costs only $22 from a local scrap yard.

This SAM module from a 07-12 Mercedes-Benz is an easy pick, and with the right presentation can fetch between $200 and $400
